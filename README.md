# Ender 5 Max Firmware Repository

Repository of firmware and root tools for the Ender 5 Max.

Once Creality releases a web page for the Ender 5 Max firmware, the script will be updated to pull automatically from that.

Root tools based on the Crealtiy firmware scripts made by [@pellcorp](https://github.com/pellcorp) for the K1 series: <https://github.com/pellcorp/creality/tree/main/firmware>

## Pre-rooted firmware

### I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BRICK YOUR PRINTER - CREATING AND INSTALLING CUSTOM FIRMWARE IS RISKY

Default password is `creality_2025` in the pre-rooted firmware

To create pre-rooted firmware, run `create.sh` and place the resulting .img file on a flash drive, then plug it into your printer.

Pre-rooted firmware OTA images can be found in the releases. Versions will always start with `V6` to allow for easy flashing

### How to install

Simply place the .img on a flash drive and insert it into the screen of the printer. Navigate to the home page if it's not already there, and it'll pop up asking to update
